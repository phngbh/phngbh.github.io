In this post, I aim to provide you with the technical details of how I adapted the natural language-based LLMs to longitudinal sparse numerical data of medical domain. Particularly, I will describe how I generated synthetic data to overcome the issues of data privacy and resource limitations; and the architecture of the adapted LLMs to bridge the gaps between the two domains. For details of applications and performance, please visit the [previous post](../projects/3.dpv).

This is yet to be written. At the mean time you can visit my [github repository](https://github.com/phngbh/DPV) for indepth instruction of how to install and run the pipeline. The paper is in production.
