### Hi guys, welcome to my personal page.

My name is Phong BH. Nguyen (I know, it's hard to pronounce), a scientist, programmer and adventurer, with a taste for all things creative. This site serves as a single starting point for everyone to get to know me. 

I am a bioinformatician/ data scientist with a strong background in molecular biology, bioinformatics, and AI-driven biomedical research. My expertise lies in developing interpretable machine learning frameworks in Python and R, integrating multi-omic and clinical data for biomarker discovery to advance mechanistic understanding and therapeutic development for cancer, diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. The ultimate goal is to translate data-driven discoveries into real-world healthcare impact. You can get to know more about my backdround and experience in [About me](./about.html), [Projects](./projects.html) and [Data visualization](./data_viz.html).

My daily work circles around understanding and utilizing data. I leverage different programming languages and computing environments to write everything from data processing and engineering code to larger frameworks to streamline workflows for both research and clinical practice. In addition, I have a massive interest in data visualization, asthetical ways to make sense of data, discover new insights and showcase research findings. Get to know more about my work in [Projects](./projects.html), [Data visualization](./data_viz.html) and [Blog](./blog.html). 

Besides work, I have an active lifestyle. At first it was pure peer pressure, but now I really enjoy doing sports like hiking, skiing, cycling, swimming, weightlifting and badminton. I also have a creative side, when I don't go out I like to write, paint, try out risky recipes or just simply read and listen to music.

If you want to get in touch, just drop me a message in one of the social platforms in [my contact info](./about.html).
